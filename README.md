#sudokuapp

this app is my first project .
first run the ml_model.py it will create a machine learning model in your directory by the name "filename.pkl" which is necessary for the running of all the other files.
then make sure "filename.pkl" is in the same directory as all the other files .

things to do:
add a check function for whether or not it is a solvable soduku.
add manual input option
add login option 
add score and timer 
optimize the ml model and also pre-process the data
